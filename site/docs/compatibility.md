NiftyCSS is **framework-agnostic**. That means you can use it with any framework, or even with vanilla JS.

In the future, we will provide wrappers for React, Vue and Svelte.

You can find guides about how to use Nifty with populars frameworks and technologies in [Installation](/docs/installation#using-with-x).
